      "durability": {
        "question": "How long does the vinyl wrap last?",
        "answer": "Our premium 3M™ vinyl wraps are designed to last 5-7 years with proper care. They resist UV damage, weather, and daily wear. We provide a 5-year warranty on all installations."
      },
      "paintDamage": {
        "question": "Will the wrap damage my scooter's paint?",
        "answer": "Absolutely not! Vinyl wraps actually protect your original paint from scratches, chips, and UV damage. When professionally removed, your paint will be in pristine condition underneath."
      },
      "customDesign": {
        "question": "Can I choose a custom design?",
        "answer": "Yes! You can choose from our ready-made designs or create your own custom design. Upload your artwork or work with our design team to create something unique. Preview it in 3D before ordering."
      },
      "installationTime": {
        "question": "How long does installation take?",
        "answer": "Professional installation typically takes 2-3 hours depending on the model and design complexity. We come to your location, so you don't need to leave your scooter anywhere."
      },
      "priceIncludes": {
        "question": "What's included in the price?",
        "answer": "The price includes premium 3M vinyl material, professional installation at your location, quality guarantee, and 5-year warranty. No hidden fees!"
      },
      "maintenance": {
        "question": "How do I maintain the wrap?",
        "answer": "Simple! Wash with mild soap and water. Avoid high-pressure washers directly on seams. No waxing needed. Detailed care instructions are provided after installation."
      },
      "removal": {
        "question": "Can I remove the wrap later?",
        "answer": "Yes, wraps can be professionally removed anytime without damaging the paint. Removal takes about 1-2 hours. We offer removal services at a discounted rate for our customers."
      },
      "paymentPlans": {
        "question": "Do you offer payment plans?",
